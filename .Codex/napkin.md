## Corrections
| Date | Source | What Went Wrong | What To Do Instead |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2026-08-23 | self | Used `rm -f` to clean isolated visual-proof files, then tried `gio trash`, which `/tmp` does not support | For exact `/tmp` proof targets, use `unlink` for files and `find <validated-dir> -depth -delete` for trees |
| 2026-08-25 | user | Opened the Studio handoff on `www.sirv.studio`, whose route did not preload the image | The companion route is `https://dev.sirv.studio/tools/image-to-image`; prove the exact CDN fetch there |
| 2026-08-25 | self | Put Markdown backticks inside a double-quoted shell search, so Bash tried to execute the text between them | Use single quotes for shell patterns that contain backticks |
| 2026-08-25 | self | Linux Clippy did not compile the non-Linux runtime fallback, where a fixed string used `format!` | Treat the macOS CI Clippy job as a release gate for target-gated branches |
| 2026-08-23 | self | Passed several test-name filters to one `cargo test` invocation, but Cargo accepts only one positional filter | Use one shared substring filter or run focused filters as separate commands |
| 2026-08-22 | self | Treated `webp::WebPConfig::new()` as `Option` in an `Option`-returning encoder | It returns `Result`; use `.ok()?` at this deliberately lossy error boundary |
| 2026-08-22 | self | Timed a long conversion through an `exec` wrapper that hid the yielded `exec_command` session id, then accidentally started a second conversion beside it | Print the full `exec_command` result as JSON and resume its `session_id` with `write_stdin`; never trust timing while another benchmark process exists |
| 2026-08-22 | self | Tried to execute the skill-creator Python helper directly, but it is not executable on this host | Invoke skill-creator helpers with `python`, even when the usage examples show the script path directly |
| 2026-08-22 | self | Assumed a newly dirty app icon came from `cargo build` and restored it before checking `build.rs`; the exact 19,611-byte file was a concurrent 8-bit conversion | Before restoring a late dirty file, inspect the producer and copy the dirty artifact aside; a clean start snapshot can race with concurrent user edits |
| 2026-08-22 | self | Trusted a plans-index DONE row without checking `src/`; 029 and 030 were marked DONE twice with no execution behind them | Verify a status against the source before building on it; a row is a claim about `src/`, not about work done |
| 2026-08-20 | user | Treated the broken GPUI headless renderer as a reason to defer screenshot-backed UI proof | Launch the real pre-alpha app, control it through Hyprland/ydotool, capture with `grim`, and visually inspect every changed state and size |

## User Preferences
- Pull current changes and run the app end to end when requested.
- For pre-alpha UI work, reshape the design freely and make real app screenshots yourself; do not wait for an in-repo headless capture test.

## Patterns That Work
- At the 760px comparison minimum, hide duplicate conversion metadata before truncating the filename, and shorten secondary action labels below 900px.
- Two local AI actions fit as direct keyboard-native buttons; a dropdown adds a click and inherits the popover trigger's keyboard gaps. Put the active action in loading state and keep the full job message in the one-line footer.
- vision.cpp 0.3.0's Linux package needs both `lib/` and `bin/` on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; its auto backend used Vulkan successfully, BiRefNet `--composite` produced RGBA, and tiled ESRGAN produced the expected 4x dimensions.
- `TableState::refresh` rebuilds cached column groups but does not notify its entity; after changing a delegate for resize, call `cx.notify()` in the same deferred table update or the old columns stay visible until another input event.
- In the audit toolbar, group filtering separately from conversion settings and stack those groups at the default/minimum widths; this keeps Resize, Format, and Quality together instead of letting one long flex row orphan Quality.
- The in-process system libavif 1.4.2 + libaom 3.14.1 + libyuv path took 9.070s versus rav1e speed 8's 21.503s on the same 64-file / 134.1MB sample (57.8% faster); output fell 8.7%, and PSNR was higher on four of five spot checks. A tiny C bridge avoids stale Rust wrappers and subprocess overhead.
- On the 5,739-image corpus, bundled libwebp 1.6.0 with zero-copy RGB/RGBA input took 28.512s versus 29.569s for the 1.3.1 wrapper (3.6% faster) and encoded five formats the wrapper rejected; converting every image to a fresh RGB buffer first regressed to 33.119s.
- Rav1e speed 8 took 20.628s versus 23.373s at speed 6 on a 64-file size-stratified real sample (11.7% faster), while output grew only 0.6%.
- For lossy WebP, libwebp method 1 with eight file workers cut the current 5,739-image / 3.0GB q80 full-size run from 69.505s to 29.608s (57.4%); output grew from 423.2MB to 480.3MB but still saved 84%. Keep method 4 for lossless/transparent images. Threaded libwebp was worse: 71.2s at eight file workers and 125.3s at four.
- A `VecDeque<Task<_>>` awaited from the front is not a sliding conversion window: one slow first file leaves completed worker slots idle. `select_all` cut a 64-file uneven WebP workload from a 2.121s median to 1.812s (14.6%) by refilling on any completion.
- When the settings overlay has only one section, name that task in the title and keep status plus secondary/primary actions in one footer; the old section label and separate Close row made the small form look oversized.
- `git pull --ff-only` followed by `cargo run --release` updates and launches the GPUI app; Cargo may fetch newly locked crates first.
- For real UI proof on Hyprland: launch `target/release/imageguide <folder>`, use `hyprctl` to focus/float/resize/move the `imageguide` window, interact with `hyprctl dispatch movecursor` plus `ydotool`/`wtype`, capture exact window geometry with `grim -g`, then inspect the PNG.
- If the desktop is locked, keep the lock intact: run the release app in headless Gamescope, capture its PipeWire node with GStreamer, and drive its Xwayland seat with `DISPLAY=:2 xdotool`. Use an isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for requested window sizes.
- In isolated Gamescope proof, `DISPLAY=:N xdotool key --window <gamescope-window> Down` then `space` verifies the list cursor and keyboard selection without touching the real desktop.
- The full non-intrusive proof recipe, verified 2026-08-22: `setsid env XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<temp> gamescope --backend headless -W 1100 -H 720 -- ./target/release/imageguide <folder> &`, read the node id from `node ID: N` in its log, then `gst-launch-1.0 -q pipewiresrc path=N num-buffers=10 ! videoconvert ! pngenc ! multifilesink location="f%03d.png"`. Drive it with `DISPLAY=:2 xdotool key/type/mousemove --window <id>`. The flag is `--backend headless`, not `--headless`.
- Do not `pkill` the app from the same Bash call that relaunches it: the kill takes the calling shell with it. Use one call to stop and a separate `setsid ... & disown` to start.
- `TableState` caches its column groups; after a viewport/result signature change, update the delegate and call `TableState::refresh` from `Context::defer`, not during `Audit::render`.
- During conversion, replace the `Slider` entity with the existing `Progress` primitive so the quality control is visibly locked and cannot receive accessibility actions; a 500-image Gamescope run exposed the active rail clearly.
- A status bar must hold one height in every state: render its meter always, colour it transparent when idle, or the list above jumps.
- GPUI key handlers only see keys that bubble through the focused element. When a view replaces the tree the click focused (list → comparison), defer `window.focus(&handle)` one frame or Escape lands nowhere.
- Per-side border colours do not exist in gpui's Styled; a row-level colour tick must be an absolute child of the row, not a border.
- Put row attributes on the row, not in the first cell: a rail inside the checkbox cell reads as checkbox decoration.
- Sirv readdir returns pretty-printed JSON; `lines().next()` on an error body yields a bare `{`. Keep the whole body, capped.
- parking_lot::Mutex is the house rule wherever `lock().unwrap()` would appear; gpui already ships it in the tree.
- When a PUT replaces a range that ends mid-construct, the leftover tail silently re-anchors to the next statement — after every structural edit, `cargo check` before the next edit, never batch two.
- Checkbox focus is nested under the audit root, so unmodified Space/Enter must stop at a wrapper `on_key_down`; otherwise the component toggles and the root cursor handler toggles again.
- An empty directory has `root.is_dir() == true` and no entries, so it must branch before the table rather than reuse the filter-empty copy.
- `bpp` was too cryptic in the real table; `B/px` fits the compact column and reads clearly in list and grid views.
- Comparison `pair == None` can mean either loading or a completed decode/encode failure; keep an explicit failed bit so the error panel and footer do not say `decoding…` forever.

## Patterns That Don't Work
- The vendored `libaom-sys 0.17.2` build fails this repo's current NASM with `multipass optimization not supported`. A system-linked libaom benchmark was promising, but do not add host-specific linkage; retry when the crate's vendored build supports the pinned toolchain.
- This Arch host has no `/usr/bin/time`; use Bash `TIMEFORMAT` and the shell `time` keyword for wall-clock benchmarks.
- Removing a settings input must also update the overlay's `FIELDS` count and focus-handle array; the Studio removal left `studio_email` there and broke the build.
- The documented ignored screenshot harness currently fails on this Linux host with `render_to_image not available: no HeadlessRenderer configured`; do not claim UI screenshot proof from `cargo test --bin imageguide -- --ignored screenshot` until the renderer setup is fixed.
- Do not persist `uniform_list` processor range as viewport state: GPUI also invokes the processor with a one-item measurement range. Read the tracked handle's public `base_handle.logical_scroll_top()` instead.
- A normal live app run writes its viewport and folder to `~/.config/imageguide/settings`; save or isolate that config before scripted resize tests, then restore it exactly.
- `DISPLAY=:N import -window <id>` against the nested Xwayland server returns a 235-byte grey rectangle. The app draws through Wayland and wgpu, so its pixels only exist on Gamescope's PipeWire node.
- A `cx.defer_in` focus grab written without a "once" guard runs on every render of the view that schedules it. In the settings panel that made Tab look broken: focus went back to the first field before the next keystroke arrived.
- I ignored the existing `/tmp` cross-filesystem warning and emitted one error per hard link again. Create the fixture under `/home/igor/.cache` and validate one link before starting the loop.

- A plan status in `plans/README.md` is a claim, not a fact. On 2026-08-22 eleven of twelve batch-2 rows said DONE and eight were not implemented; the file was also edited mid-session to mark 029 DONE while its own dependencies were open. Verify against `src/` before building on a row.
- A test that only pairs `save_credentials_at` with `load_credentials_from` proves nothing about `save_credentials` and `load_credentials`. That gap hid a path bug that meant Sirv keys never persisted at all. Test the pair the application calls.
- Measure a performance idea before building on it. Decoding a JPEG at an eighth of its size sounded obvious and ran *slower*: `jpeg-decoder` is the only crate that offers scaling, it has no SIMD, and DCT scaling saves the inverse transform, not the Huffman pass that dominates. Reverted with the dependency.
- Launch the app for UI proof even when the tests pass. A notice reading "optimized/ already holds 5415 files" on a folder with no output directory exposed a real bug: `scan` skipped every path with an `optimized` component but counted them all, and those files were in a nested `Screenshots/optimized` no run would touch.
- Do not judge an estimator by reasoning about its bias. Convert a real folder to get ground truth, then sweep the sampling offset: the "obvious" fix (stratified slices) moved a −98% error to a −6% median but still swung between −53% and +59% at 16 slices. Only the sweep showed that 32 slices was the setting worth shipping.

## Domain Notes
- The desktop app binary is `target/release/imageguide`.
- The normal baseline is green: 36 tests pass, with the screenshot test ignored; clippy and `cargo fmt --check` also pass at `05384d3`.
- Benchmark folders: hardlink-mirror `~/Pictures` into `~/.cache/` (`/tmp` is tmpfs, so `ln` fails across filesystems). 5,732 images / 3.0 GB convert to 422.9 MB at WebP q80 full size.
- Measured on this 16-core host at `52520d2`: WebP conversion 54.3s serial vs 9.3s parallel for 255 MB; AVIF 128s serial, 88s at two files at once, 83s at four. rav1e already spends about 6 cores on a single image, so only WebP wants a worker per core.
- `ravif`'s `asm` and `threading` features are on by default and `nasm` is installed, so the rav1e assembly is already built. The old `convert.rs` module comment claiming otherwise was wrong.
- `/tmp` is on a different filesystem from `/home/igor/Pictures` here; put hard-link benchmark fixtures under `/home/igor/.cache`, or `ln` emits one cross-device error per file.
- Gamescope PipeWire is damage-driven: `videorate` plus `num-buffers` does not produce a fixed-rate frame run when the app is idle. Bound continuous captures with `timeout`; do not wait for a frame count.
- A 6,000-image GPUI conversion stress run took 2.557s before progress batching and 2.481s after it (3% wall-time gain); do not market that as a 70% conversion speedup. The honest UI metric is progress invalidations: 6,000 to 750 for WebP (87.5% fewer), plus cached visible bytes remove the remaining O(folder size) header scan from each redraw.
